For the purpose of this course we suggest you use spyder, a relatively easy to use IDE which comes prepackaged with winpython, but we invite you to explore other options, both those included with winpython and others.\n",

You'll notice that on the right there is a section called the ipython console. This will be useful for running single commands or executing functions, which we'll learn about later. On the left you'll see the script editor, this is for writing scripts, or anything that takes your fancy.\n",
