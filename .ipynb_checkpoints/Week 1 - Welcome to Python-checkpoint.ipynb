For the purpose of this course we suggest you use spyder, a relatively easy to use IDE which comes prepackaged with winpython, but we invite you to explore other options, both those included with winpython and others.\n",

On the left you'll see the script editor, this is for writing scripts, or anything that takes your fancy.\n",
